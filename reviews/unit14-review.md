# Unit 14 Review: I was doing (past continuous) and I did (simple past)

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Outstanding Visual Explanation**: The time-line diagram (Lines 127-140) is an excellent visual aid that clearly shows the relationship between the background action (continuous) and the interrupting event (simple past). This is pedagogically superior to text-only explanations.

2. **Comprehensive Pattern Coverage**: The unit covers multiple patterns:
   - Past continuous + when + simple past
   - While + past continuous
   - Two simultaneous progressive actions
   - Sequential actions with simple past
   This gives students a complete understanding of how to combine these tenses.

3. **Creative "Alibi Game" Activity**: Section 7's alibi game (Lines 606-611) is an engaging, communicative activity that naturally elicits past continuous usage in a fun, memorable context.

### Issues Found

#### Critical Issues
- **None identified**

#### Minor Issues

1. **Structural Inconsistency**: Same metadata issues as previous units.
   - Location: Lines 1-7

2. **Complexity Level**: This unit is more conceptually demanding than previous units. Some 6th graders might find the distinction between background vs. event challenging.
   - Consideration: This is appropriate for the curriculum progression, not necessarily an issue.

3. **Part C Answer 5** (Line 724): "I ate and went to school" is marked as the correction for "I was eating and went to school", but the original error is mixing tenses inappropriately. The context should clarify this is for sequential actions.
   - Location: Lines 675-677, 724

4. **While/When Simplification**: The rule "when + simple past, while + past continuous" is presented as absolute, but in practice, these can sometimes be interchanged. This is fine for elementary learners but could be noted as a simplification.
   - Location: Section 1

### Specific Corrections Needed

1. **Clarify the context for Part C Question 5** (Lines 675-677):
   - Add context: "For sequential/completed actions:"
   - Original: "I was eating and went to school."
   - Correction: "I ate and went to school." (because these are two completed actions in sequence)

2. **Add design elements entry** for the visual aid:
   ```yaml
   - element: "Visual Aid"
     implementation: "시간선 다이어그램으로 시각적 이해 도움"
   ```
   - Note: This is actually already present at Lines 871-872. No change needed.

3. **Consider adding a "difficulty notice"** at the start of the unit:
   ```markdown
   이 단원은 조금 어려울 수 있어요. 천천히 배워봅시다!
   ```

### Quality Rating

**9/10**

### Recommendation

**APPROVE**

This is an excellent unit that tackles a complex grammatical distinction with clarity and creativity. The visual timeline, comprehensive pattern coverage, and engaging activities make this a strong teaching resource. The minor clarifications suggested would enhance clarity but are not essential. This unit represents some of the best work in the batch.
