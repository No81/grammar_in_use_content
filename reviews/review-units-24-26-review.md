---

## Critical Issues Found

**None. No critical issues identified.**

---

## Minor Issues Found

### 1. Typo/Redundancy (Line 292)
**Location:** Section 9, Part B, Question 12

**Current:**
```yaml
answer: "b) I'm going to Jeju. (또는 I'm going to Jeju.)<br />설명: 표를 샀으므로 확정된 계획"
```

**Issue:** Both options are identical. Should provide alternative (present continuous).

**Suggested Fix:**
```yaml
answer: "b) I'm going to Jeju. (또는 I'm going to Jeju next month.)<br />설명: 표를 샀으므로 확정된 계획. 현재진행형(I'm going to Jeju)도 가능하지만 going to가 더 자연스러움"
```

### 2. Inconsistent Emoji Usage
**Location:** Throughout document

**Issue:** Less emoji usage compared to review-units-1-9.yaml. Could enhance visual appeal and engagement for 6th graders.

**Examples to add:**
- Section titles could use emojis (📝, 🎯, 💪, etc.)
- More encouragement emojis in feedback sections

### 3. Time Allocation Clarification
**Location:** Line 26 and estimated_time section

**Current:** "Section 3, 5, 9만 풀어도 충분히 효과적인 복습이 됩니다! (약 25분)"

**Calculation Check:**
- Section 3: 10분
- Section 5: 12분
- Section 9: 20분
- **Total: 42분** (not 25분)

**Suggested Fix:**
```yaml
content: "⏱️ 시간이 부족하다면? Section 3, 5, 9만 풀어도 충분히 효과적인 복습이 됩니다! (약 40분)"
```

### 4. Enhanced Differentiation Example
**Location:** Line 117

**Current:** Both options given without clear explanation of nuance difference.

**Enhancement Opportunity:** Explain why present continuous might also work here:
```yaml
answer: "b) I'm going to Busan. / I'm going to Busan tomorrow.<br />설명: 이미 표를 샀으므로 확정된 계획 (be going to). 표를 샀다는 것은 준비 완료이므로 현재진행형(I'm going to Busan)도 가능하지만, 맥락상 going to가 더 명확함"
```

---

## Specific Corrections Needed

### Correction 1: Fix Answer Redundancy (Line 292)
**Priority:** Low

**Change:**
```yaml
question: "12. 이미 비행기표를 샀다. '나는 제주도에 갈 거야'<br />a) I go to Jeju.  b) I'm going to Jeju.  c) I go to Jeju."
answer: "b) I'm going to Jeju.<br />설명: 표를 샀으므로 확정된 계획. 현재진행형도 가능"
```

### Correction 2: Fix Time Estimate (Line 26)
**Priority:** Low

**Change:**
```yaml
content: "⏱️ 시간이 부족하다면? Section 3, 5, 9만 풀어도 충분히 효과적인 복습이 됩니다! (약 40분)"
```

### Correction 3: Enhance Visual Engagement (Optional)
**Priority:** Very Low

Add more emojis to section titles and feedback for better engagement with 6th-grade learners.
