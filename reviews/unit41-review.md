## Evaluation Criteria Assessment

### 1. Pedagogical Quality (9/10)

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive contraction table covering all major auxiliaries
- Strong error correction focus (Section 6) addresses common mistakes directly
- Good progression from contraction recognition to sentence transformation
- Includes real-life application with personal expression

**Minor Issues:**
- Could include more on double negatives, which is a common error pattern

### 2. Content Accuracy (10/10)

**Strengths:**
- All contractions correctly presented
- Accurate explanation of "won't" as irregular (not "willn't")
- Correct note that "amn't" does not exist
- Proper emphasis on base verb after don't/doesn't/didn't

**No issues found:** All grammatical content is accurate.

### 3. Completeness (9/10)

**Strengths:**
- All 10 required sections present
- Comprehensive coverage of contractions (be, do, have, modals)
- Good variety of exercise types
- Includes emphasis patterns ("I do NOT like it")

**Minor Issues:**
- Could expand on "never" as an alternative negative marker
- Brief mention of "no" + noun construction (e.g., "There is no milk") could be added

### 4. Format & Structure (10/10)

**Strengths:**
- Consistent YAML structure
- Proper type designations
- Clean formatting
- Matches reference template

**No syntax errors detected.**

### 5. Target Audience Alignment (8/10)

**Strengths:**
- Korean translations provided for examples
- Common Korean learner errors explicitly addressed
- Practical exercises about personal dislikes and inabilities

**Issues:**
- Line 43 mentions "double negative" but doesn't explain why it's wrong in English (valid in Korean)
- Some vocabulary may be slightly advanced (e.g., "mustn't," "shouldn't" less common for 6th graders)
- Could use more school-life examples

### 6. Consistency with Existing Units (10/10)

**Strengths:**
- Same 10-section structure
- Consistent formatting conventions
- Parallel exercise types
- Similar depth of content

## Detailed Findings

### Strengths (Top 3)

1. **Comprehensive Contraction Coverage:** All major contractions are presented in one clear list (Section 1, Lines 9-20), serving as an excellent reference.

2. **Strong Error Correction Focus:** Section 6 directly targets the most common errors (doesn't likes, amn't, willn't, I not understand), using a diagnostic approach.

3. **Special Forms Highlighted:** Explicit attention to irregular forms (won't, can't, I'm not) prevents common spelling and formation errors.

### Issues Found

#### Critical Issues: None

#### Minor Issues:

1. **Section 1, Line 43 (Note):** Double negative explanation is incomplete.
   - **Current:** "1. Double negative: I don't have nothing (X) -> I don't have anything (O)"
   - **Issue:** Doesn't explain WHY double negatives are wrong in English
   - **Suggested addition:** Add after the examples: "In English, unlike Korean, using two negatives makes a positive. 'I don't have nothing' means 'I have something' in standard English."

2. **Section 7, A4 (Line 199):** "shouldn't" and "mustn't" may be unfamiliar.
   - **Current:** "Make 2 sentences giving advice about what not to do."
   - **Suggestion:** Add scaffolding: "Use shouldn't (shouldn't do) or mustn't (must not do)."

3. **Target audience alignment:** More school-specific examples needed.
   - **Suggestion:** Add examples like "I didn't do my homework," "She doesn't understand the question," "We can't use phones in class."

4. **Section 1:** Missing explicit comparison with Korean.
   - **Suggestion:** Add: "In Korean, 'don't' is expressed by verb endings (-ji anha), but English requires a separate word (do/does/did + not)."

## Specific Corrections Needed

### Minor Corrections Required:

1. **Section 1, Line 43 (Note section):** Expand double negative explanation.

   **Current:**
   ```
   1. Double negative: I don't have nothing (X) -> I don't have anything (O)
   ```

   **Change to:**
   ```
   1. Double negative: I don't have nothing (X) -> I don't have anything (O)
      In English, two negatives make a positive meaning. In Korean, double negatives emphasize negation, but in English, they cancel out.
   ```

2. **Section 7, Line 199 (A4):** Add scaffolding for modal usage.

   **Current:**
   ```
   Make 2 sentences giving advice about what not to do.
   ```

   **Change to:**
   ```
   Make 2 sentences giving advice about what not to do. (Hint: Use shouldn't or mustn't)
   ```

3. **Section 1:** Add Korean comparison after Line 48.

   **Add:**
   ```yaml
   - type: text
     content: "<span class='highlight'>Korean vs English negation:</span><br />
       - Korean: Uses verb endings (-ji anha) for negation<br />
       - English: Must use separate negative words (not, don't, can't)<br />
       - Example: 'I don't eat meat' vs '고기를 안 먹어요'"
   ```

## Quality Rating

| Criterion | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Pedagogical Quality | 9/10 |
| Content Accuracy | 10/10 |
| Completeness | 9/10 |

## Recommendation

**APPROVED WITH MINOR REVISIONS RECOMMENDED**

The unit meets the target score of 9/10 but would benefit from the minor corrections noted above, particularly:

1. **Highest Priority:** Expand the double negative explanation (Line 43) to address L1 transfer issues
2. **Recommended:** Add Korean vs. English comparison for negation formation
3. **Optional:** Add scaffolding for modal usage in Section 7

The unit is fundamentally sound and can be used as-is, but implementing the suggested changes would improve its effectiveness for Korean learners specifically.

## Reviewer Notes

- Solid foundational coverage of English negation
- Error correction focus is particularly valuable
- Contraction table serves as useful quick reference
- Could strengthen L1 transfer considerations (especially double negative issue)
- Modal negatives (shouldn't, mustn't) may need additional support for 6th graders
- Overall structure and exercise variety are excellent
