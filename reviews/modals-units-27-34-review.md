## Critical Issues (MUST FIX)

**None identified.** All units are structurally sound, pedagogically appropriate, and ready for publication.

---

## Minor Issues (Optional Fixes)

### 1. **Consistency in Percentage Representation** (Units 27, 29)

**Location:** Unit 27, Section 1, Line 16; Unit 29, Section 1, Line 16

**Current:**
- Unit 27: "약 30~50% 정도의 불확실한 가능성"
- Unit 29: "(1) 의무: '반드시 ~해야 한다' (90% 확신) (2) 추측: '~임에 틀림없다' (95% 확신)"

**Issue:** Percentages are helpful for learners but may be overly technical for 6th graders.

**Suggestion:** Consider simplifying to descriptive terms like "낮은 가능성", "높은 확신" without numbers, or keep percentages as reference.

**Severity:** Low - Current approach is acceptable

---

### 2. **Advanced Grammar in Unit 27** (Line 14)

**Location:** Unit 27, Section 1, Line 14

**Current:** "과거: 주어 + might have + 과거분사 (과거에 ~했을지도 모른다)"

**Issue:** "Might have + past participle" is quite advanced for 6th graders and not practiced in the unit.

**Suggestion:** Either add practice for this form or move it to a "Further Study" note.

**Severity:** Low - Mentioned but not required for this level

---

### 3. **Translation Nuance in Unit 32** (Various)

**Location:** Unit 32, Section 5, T2, T6

**Current:**
- T2: "피자 주세요." → "I'd like a pizza, please."
- T6: "물 좀 주세요." → "I'd like some water, please."

**Issue:** Both acceptable answers show "I'd like a pizza" and "I'd like some pizza" - should clarify when to use countable vs uncountable.

**Suggestion:** Add brief note about "a pizza" (whole pizza) vs "some pizza" (slice/portion).

**Severity:** Very Low - Both forms are correct

---

### 4. **Unit 34 Title Length**

**Location:** Unit 34, Line 1

**Current:** "Unit 34 · Do this! Don't do that! Let's do this! (명령문/제안)"

**Issue:** Title is longer than other units, which use shorter forms.

**Suggestion:** Shorten to "Unit 34 · Imperative & Let's (명령문/제안)" for consistency.

**Severity:** Very Low - Current title is clear and engaging
