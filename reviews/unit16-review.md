## Issues Found

### Critical Errors (Must Fix)

**None identified** - All grammar explanations are accurate, YAML structure is correct, and content is original.

### Pedagogical Concerns (Should Fix)

1. **Section 3 (Retrieval Practice)** - Minor
   - **Issue**: R5 asks students to write an example from memory but doesn't emphasize that any correct structure is acceptable
   - **Impact**: Students might feel they need to recall exact examples from Section 1
   - **Suggestion**: Add note that "any correct present perfect question you create is acceptable"

2. **Section 7 (Real-life Application)** - Minor
   - **Issue**: A5 is slightly vague ("things that happened today")
   - **Impact**: May be too open-ended for some students
   - **Suggestion**: Provide more specific scenario prompts like "ask about mail, weather, or completed tasks"

### Enhancement Opportunities (Nice to Have)

1. **Visual Aids**: Consider adding a simple table showing Have vs Has subject agreement
2. **Pronunciation Note**: Add note about the contracted form pronunciation (haven't/hasn't)
3. **Cross-reference**: Could mention that next units will cover duration questions (How long have you...?)

## Priority Recommendations

### Top 3 Changes to Make:

1. **Clarify R5 in Section 3**: Add note that any structurally correct present perfect question is acceptable, not just memorized examples
   - **Rationale**: Reduces student anxiety and encourages creative production

2. **Refine A5 in Section 7**: Make the prompt more specific with 2-3 concrete scenario examples
   - **Rationale**: Better scaffolding for students who need more guidance

3. **Add subject-verb agreement table in Section 1**: Visual summary of Have (I, you, we, they) vs Has (he, she, it)
   - **Rationale**: Visual learners benefit from tables; reinforces the key distinction

---

## Enhancement Ideas

- Add a "Tip Box" with common irregular past participles used in the unit (seen, done, eaten, given, met, stopped)
- Include a brief note about British vs American usage (UK: Have you got? vs US: Do you have?)
- Consider adding a peer-practice activity where students interview each other with Have you ever...? questions
