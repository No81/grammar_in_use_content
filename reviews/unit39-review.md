## Detailed Findings

### Strengths (Top 3)

1. **Pragmatic Focus:** Exceptionally clear explanation of WHEN to use each form, not just HOW. This functional approach helps learners choose appropriately in real situations.

2. **Contrast-Based Learning:** Direct juxtaposition of formal vs. rising intonation questions (e.g., "Are you Korean?" vs. "You're Korean?") makes the distinction memorable.

3. **Situation-Based Practice:** Section 5 requires learners to choose the appropriate question type based on context (first meeting, expressing surprise, etc.), promoting pragmatic competence.

### Issues Found

#### Critical Issues: None

#### Minor Issues:

1. **Section 5, Line 134-135 (T5):** Interview context may not resonate with 6th graders.
   - **Current:** "When asking about experience in an interview (use formal question)"
   - **Suggested:** Change to: "When the teacher asks if you've done homework (use formal question)"

2. **Section 1:** No mention of written representation of intonation.
   - **Suggestion:** Add brief note that in texting/writing, rising intonation questions often use multiple question marks or exclamation points (e.g., "You passed?!" or "You're leaving??")

3. **Line 69, Section 2:** The term "ascending intonation question" could be simplified.
   - **Current:** "ascending intonation question" (Korean: rising intonation question)
   - **Note:** This is acceptable but could also be called "echo questions" for advanced learners

## Specific Corrections Needed

### No critical corrections required.

### Minor enhancement suggestions:

1. **Section 5, T5 (Lines 134-135):**
   - **Current:** "When asking about experience in an interview (use formal question)"
   - **Change to:** "When asking a new classmate about their previous school (use formal question)"
   - **Why:** More age-appropriate context

2. **Section 1 (after Line 38):** Add a text item:
   - **Add:** "In texting or online chatting, rising intonation questions often appear with multiple question marks (You passed??) or exclamation points (You won?!) to show surprise."
