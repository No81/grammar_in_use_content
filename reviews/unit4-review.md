## Dimension 5: Technical Quality - YAML Structure

**Score: 9.5/10** ✅

### YAML Syntax Validation

**Status: EXCELLENT**

**Structure Analysis:**
- ✅ Valid YAML syntax throughout
- ✅ Proper indentation (2 spaces)
- ✅ Consistent use of lists and mappings
- ✅ Proper quoting for special characters
- ✅ HTML content properly embedded in strings

**Hierarchy:**
```yaml
title: [string]
meta: [string]
sections: [array]
  - title: [string]
    items: [array]
      - type: [string]
        content/question/answer/etc: [string]
```

**Result: Structure is correct and parseable.**

### Content Type Usage

**Status: EXCELLENT**

**Content Types Used:**
1. ✅ `type: text` - Explanatory content (used 8 times)
2. ✅ `type: list` - Examples and forms (used 2 times)
3. ✅ `type: note` - Warnings and instructions (used 10 times)
4. ✅ `type: qna` - Questions and answers (used 51 times)

**All content types are:**
- Semantically appropriate
- Consistently formatted
- Contain all required fields

### HTML Formatting

**Status: EXCELLENT**

**HTML Elements Used:**
- ✅ `<span class='highlight'>` for emphasis
- ✅ `<br />` for line breaks (self-closing, XHTML-style)
- ✅ Proper nesting and closing of tags
- ✅ No unclosed tags or syntax errors

**Accessibility Note:**
HTML is minimal and semantic. Could consider using `<strong>` instead of `<span class='highlight'>` for better semantic HTML, but current usage is acceptable for educational display purposes.

### Data Consistency

**Status: EXCELLENT**

**Consistency Checks:**
- ✅ All QnA items have both `question` and `answer` fields
- ✅ All list items have both `heading` and `list` fields
- ✅ Text items consistently use `content` field
- ✅ Note items consistently use `content` field
- ✅ No missing or misnamed fields

### Minor Technical Consideration (-0.5)

**Line 11-13:** Very long strings with multiple `<br />` tags could be split into separate text items for better maintainability:

```yaml
# Current (works but dense):
- "<span class='highlight'>Am/Is/Are + 주어 + 동사-ing...?</span> (Yes/No 질문)<br />Are you eating lunch? (너 지금 점심 먹고 있니?)<br />Is she playing games? (그녀는 지금 게임하고 있니?)"

# Suggested (more maintainable):
- "<span class='highlight'>Am/Is/Are + 주어 + 동사-ing...?</span> (Yes/No 질문)"
- "Are you eating lunch? (너 지금 점심 먹고 있니?)"
- "Is she playing games? (그녀는 지금 게임하고 있니?)"
```

However, this is a **very minor style preference** and does not affect functionality.

## Recommendations

### Strengths to Maintain

1. **Exceptional example diversity:** The 12 examples covering academic, social, emotional, and daily contexts are a model for future units.

2. **Korean learner-specific error focus:** The explicit attention to L1 transfer errors (be-verb omission, do/does confusion, word order) is pedagogically valuable.

3. **Scaffolding quality:** The progression from controlled practice (Section 4) to free production (Section 7) is expertly designed.

4. **Answer key quality:** The inclusion of "평가 기준" and multiple acceptable answers makes the material highly usable.

5. **Self-assessment integration:** Section 10 effectively promotes metacognition and learner autonomy.

6. **Spaced repetition:** Section 9 supports long-term retention.

### Minor Enhancements (Optional)

1. **Cognitive break suggestion:** Consider adding a brief note between Section 7 and 8:
   ```yaml
   - type: note
     content: "☕ 잠깐 쉬어가기: 여기까지 잘했어요! 1-2분 쉬었다가 종합 문제로 넘어가세요."
   ```

2. **YAML formatting refinement:** Consider splitting very long strings (lines 11-13) into separate list items for easier maintenance.

3. **Semantic HTML:** Consider using `<strong>` or `<em>` instead of `<span class='highlight'>` for better semantic meaning, though current usage is acceptable.

### No Required Changes

**This unit is ready for deployment.** All critical standards are met, and the content is of exceptional quality. The minor enhancements listed above are optional improvements, not necessary corrections.
