## Specific Strengths

### 1. **Exceptional Korean Learner Support**
```yaml
⚠️ 한국 학습자가 자주 하는 실수:
1. be동사 빠뜨리기: The door locked (X) → The door is locked (O)
2. 과거분사 대신 원형 사용: is clean (X) → is cleaned (O)
3. 능동태와 수동태 혼동: I am break the window (X) → The window is broken (O)
4. 불규칙 과거분사 형태: is wrote (X) → is written (O)
```
This section targets actual Korean learner errors based on L1 interference.

### 2. **Clear Use Case Guidance**
The "언제 쓰나요?" section provides four distinct contexts:
- 행위자가 불분명하거나 중요하지 않을 때
- 결과나 상태에 집중할 때
- 공식적이거나 객관적인 설명
- 행위의 대상을 강조할 때

### 3. **Diverse, Contextual Examples**
Examples span 12+ contexts: 일상, 언어, 가족, 학교, 음식, 사고, 엔터테인먼트, 기술, 놀이

### 4. **Progressive Complexity**
- Section 4: Basic fill-in-the-blank
- Section 5: Translation (production)
- Section 6: Transformation (active ↔ passive)
- Section 7: Real-world application
- Section 8: Synthesis and error correction

### 5. **Excellent Assessment Rubrics**
Each answer includes clear evaluation criteria:
```yaml
answer: "was, sent<br />설명: 과거 시제이므로 was! send의 과거분사는 sent (불규칙)."
```

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues: None ✅

### Minor Issues:

**Issue 1: Terminology Consistency (Very Minor)**
- **Location:** Line 11
- **Current:** "과거분사(p.p.)"
- **Observation:** Some units use "과거분사" without "(p.p.)" abbreviation
- **Suggestion:** Verify if abbreviation usage is consistent across all units
- **Priority:** Low (stylistic preference)

**Issue 2: Example Redundancy (Very Minor)**
- **Location:** Line 34 vs. Line 12
- **Observation:** "The homework is checked by the teacher" (line 34) is very similar to the concept in line 14
- **Impact:** Minimal - repetition aids learning
- **Priority:** Very Low (not requiring change)

---

## Specific Corrections Needed

### No Critical Corrections Required ✅

### Optional Enhancements (Suggestions Only):

**Enhancement 1: Add Connection to Previous Units**
- **Location:** End of Section 1 or beginning of Section 2
- **Suggestion:** Consider adding a brief note connecting to Unit 10 (was/were) or other past tense units learned
- **Example:**
```yaml
- type: text
  content: "<span class='highlight'>이전 유닛과의 연결:</span><br />• Unit 10에서 배운 was/were를 수동태에서도 사용해요!<br />• 과거분사는 새로운 동사 형태로, 원형-과거형-과거분사 3단 변화를 익혀야 해요."
```
- **Priority:** Optional (unit is complete without this)

**Enhancement 2: Visual Pattern Recognition**
- **Location:** Section 2 (Noticing)
- **Current State:** Good pattern discovery questions
- **Optional Addition:** Could add visual formatting to help pattern recognition:
```yaml
- "The museum is <u>opened</u> at 9 AM."
- "The house was <u>built</u> in 2010."
```
- **Priority:** Very Low (current version is fine)
