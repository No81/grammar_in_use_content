## Detailed Evaluation

### 1. Pedagogical Quality (10/10)

**Strengths:**
- **Spaced Repetition:** Excellent implementation with Section 9 (내일 복습용 문제) providing structured review
- **Retrieval Practice:** Section 3 effectively requires students to recall without looking back
- **Progressive Difficulty:** Exercises move logically from basic fill-in-the-blanks → translation → transformation → real-life application
- **Noticing Activities:** Section 2 uses inductive learning effectively, helping students discover patterns independently
- **Elaborative Interrogation:** Questions like "Q3. 왜 필요한가요?" encourage deeper thinking about the grammar
- **Metacognition:** Section 10 includes excellent self-assessment questions that promote learning awareness

**Evidence of Research-Based Learning:**
- Questions are scaffolded appropriately (easy → moderate → challenging)
- Multiple exposure to the same concept in different contexts
- Active recall is prioritized over passive recognition
- Self-explanation is embedded in the review questions

### 2. Content Accuracy (10/10)

**Strengths:**
- Grammar explanations are 100% accurate

- The distinction between present progressive (현재) vs future (미래) is clearly explained

- Accurate differentiation from "be going to" and "will"

**Example Quality:**
- "I'm meeting Sarah at 5." - Natural, common usage

- Q1: "I _______ (meet) my friend tomorrow." → am meeting
- Provides verb in parentheses for scaffolding

**Level 2 - Intermediate (Sections 5-6):**
- Translation exercises require production, not just recognition

## Issues Found

### CRITICAL Issues: 0

**None identified.** The unit meets all quality standards.

### MINOR Issues: 3

**MINOR-1: Use of Emojis (Line 19)**
- **Location:** Section 1, line 19
- **Issue:** Uses emoji "📌" in content
- **Impact:** Minor - may not render consistently across all platforms
- **Current:** `<strong>📌 확정된 약속:</strong>`
- **Suggestion:** Consider replacing with bullet points or text markers
- **Action:** Optional - emojis work on most modern systems, but pure text is more reliable

**MINOR-2: Slight Redundancy in Examples**
- **Location:** Section 1, lines 11-15 and 22-35
- **Issue:** Some overlap between "형식 (Form)" list and "더 많은 예문" list
- **Current:** Both sections show "I am meeting him tomorrow" concept
- **Impact:** Very minor - actually reinforces learning through repetition
- **Action:** No change needed - this repetition supports spaced learning

**MINOR-3: Could Add More Context Clues**
- **Location:** Section 4, Q6-Q8
- **Issue:** Questions Q6-Q8 introduce question/negative forms without prior fill-in practice of affirmative forms with those subjects
- **Current:** Jumps from Q5 (He) to Q6 (Are you)
- **Suggestion:** Could add Q5.5 for smoother transition
- **Impact:** Very minor - students can still complete successfully
- **Action:** Optional improvement for future versions

```

**Optional-2: Add One More Basic Example (Section 4)**
```yaml
# Could add between Q5 and Q6:

  question: "Q5b. You _______ (visit) your grandmother this weekend."
  answer: "are visiting<br />설명: You + are + visiting 형태입니다."
```
