- Strong implementation of retrieval practice (Section 3) following research-based memory consolidation principles
- Includes spaced repetition section (Section 9) for long-term retention
- Noticing activities (Section 2) allow learners to discover patterns inductively

**Minor Issues:**

**No issues found:** All grammatical content is accurate.

### 3. Completeness (9/10)

**Strengths:**

- Comprehensive coverage of auxiliary types (be, do, can, will, have)
- Good variety of exercise types (fill-in-the-blank, sentence completion, error correction, real-life application)
- Includes both short answers to questions AND agreement/disagreement with statements

**Minor Issue:**
- Could include a few more examples with modal verbs like "should" and "would"

- Matches reference unit (unit35) structure exactly

**No syntax errors detected.**

### 5. Target Audience Alignment (9/10)

- Common Korean learner mistakes explicitly addressed (Section 1, note)
- Comparison with Korean language response patterns included
- Vocabulary and situations appropriate for 6th graders (school, friends, family)

**Minor Issue:**
- Some examples like "Have you been to Tokyo?" might be slightly advanced; consider using more common situations

## Detailed Findings

### Strengths (Top 3)

1. **Comprehensive Auxiliary Coverage:** The unit systematically covers all major auxiliaries (am/is/are, do/does/did, can, will, have/has) with consistent examples for each, making it easy for learners to see patterns.

2. **Strong L1 Transfer Awareness:** Explicit comparison between Korean ("Yes/No" only) and English (Yes/No + subject + auxiliary) response patterns directly addresses a key challenge for Korean learners.

3. **Practical Application Focus:** Section 7 (Real-life Application) uses authentic situations like responding to teachers, parents, and friends, making the grammar immediately useful.

### Issues Found

#### Critical Issues: None

#### Minor Issues:

1. **Section 1, Line 38:** The example "Have you been to Japan?" uses present perfect, which may not yet be familiar to all 6th graders.
   - **Current:** "Have you been to Japan? - No, I haven't. (no, I haven't been)"
   - **Suggested:** Add a simpler alternative or ensure this is marked as an advanced example

2. **Section 6:** Limited variety in agreement/disagreement scenarios.
   - **Suggestion:** Add 1-2 more context-rich examples (e.g., movie preferences, sports)

---

## Specific Corrections Needed

### No critical corrections required.

### Minor enhancement suggestions:

1. **Line 38-39:** Consider adding a note that present perfect will be covered in detail in later units

2. **Section 7, A5:** The open-ended question could provide more scaffolding:
   - **Current:** "Create 3 questions and short answers about today."
   - **Suggested:** "Create 3 questions and short answers about today. Use different auxiliaries (am, do, can, will, etc.)."
