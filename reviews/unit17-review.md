# Content Review Report - Unit 17

## Unit: How long have you . . . ? (Duration Questions)

---

## Overall Assessment

Unit 17 effectively teaches duration questions with "How long have you...?" The content demonstrates strong pedagogical design with clear explanations, abundant examples, and appropriate practice activities. The unit successfully connects to prior knowledge (Unit 16) while introducing new complexity with for/since distinctions.

**Overall Rating**: Excellent

**Quality Score**: 9/10

---

## Strengths

1. **Excellent Example Quantity and Diversity**: Section 1 provides 12 diverse examples covering various contexts (school, sports, friends, family, hobbies, health, daily life, weather)
2. **Strong for/since Foundation**: Provides solid groundwork for Unit 18 by introducing for (duration) vs since (starting point) distinction
3. **Effective L1 Transfer Error Coverage**: Addresses critical errors like "How long time" (incorrect) and confusion between present perfect and simple past for ongoing situations
4. **Clear Semantic Distinction**: Excellent explanation of why "How long have you lived here?" (still living) differs from "How long did you live there?" (no longer living)
5. **Well-Integrated Retrieval Practice**: Section 3 effectively tests both form and meaning with appropriate scaffolding
6. **Practical Real-life Applications**: Section 7 tasks connect to students' actual experiences (school, hobbies, personal duration)

## Issues Found

### Critical Errors (Must Fix)

**None identified** - Grammar explanations are accurate, YAML structure is valid, and content is pedagogically sound.

### Pedagogical Concerns (Should Fix)

1. **Section 4, Q3 (know - known)** - Minor Clarification Needed
   - **Issue**: The explanation states "know의 과거분사는 known (불규칙)" but doesn't explicitly contrast with the past form "knew"
   - **Impact**: Students may confuse knew (past) with known (past participle)
   - **Suggestion**: Add brief note: "know-knew-known (knew는 과거형, known은 과거분사)"

2. **Section 6, TF6** - Answer Variability
   - **Issue**: "They have waited for two hours" becomes "How long have they waited?" but could also accept "How long have they been waiting?"
   - **Impact**: Students using progressive form might think they're wrong
   - **Suggestion**: Add the progressive form as an alternative acceptable answer

3. **Section 8, C4** - Time Reference Accuracy
   - **Issue**: Answer mentions "for about 4-5 years" but actual calculation from 2020 to 2025 is 5 years
   - **Impact**: Students might learn imprecise time calculations
   - **Suggestion**: Update to "for five years" or "for about five years"

### Enhancement Opportunities (Nice to Have)

1. **Present Perfect Continuous Preview**: Brief mention that "How long have you been studying?" is also possible
2. **Common Duration Expressions List**: Add a list of common time periods (a few weeks, several months, many years)
3. **Connecting Words**: Could include "since I was..." patterns more explicitly

## Priority Recommendations

### Top 3 Changes to Make:

1. **Update C4 time calculation**: Change "for about 4-5 years" to "for five years" for accuracy
   - **Rationale**: Students should learn precise time calculations

2. **Enhance Q3 (Section 4) explanation**: Add "know-knew-known" paradigm to clarify the three forms
   - **Rationale**: Prevents confusion between past and past participle forms

3. **Add progressive form alternative to TF6**: Include "How long have they been waiting?" as acceptable
   - **Rationale**: Validates students who use grammatically correct alternative forms

---

## Enhancement Ideas

- Add a brief comparison table showing "for + period" vs "since + point in time" with visual examples
- Include a note about how to calculate duration when only the starting year is given
- Consider adding a "common questions" list for this structure (How long have you known...?, How long have you lived...?, How long have you had...?)
- Mention that "for a long time," "for ages," and "for years" are common informal expressions
