# Unit 15 Review: I used to... (과거의 습관/상태)

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Clear Semantic Distinction**: The unit effectively explains that "used to" implies a contrast with the present state ("지금은 안 한다/다르다"). This is repeatedly reinforced through examples and the "but now..." pattern.

2. **Excellent Summary of Past Tense Series**: Section 10 (Lines 872-879) provides a comprehensive summary of Units 10-15, helping students see the big picture and how all the past tense forms relate to each other. This is excellent for consolidation.

3. **Strong Focus on Common Errors**: The unit explicitly addresses the "used vs use" confusion in negatives and questions (Lines 126-137), which is a critical error point. This is reinforced through multiple error correction exercises.

4. **Developmentally Appropriate Examples**: Examples about believing in Santa Claus, childhood habits, and physical changes (being short/tall) are highly relatable for 6th graders reflecting on their own growth.

### Issues Found

#### Critical Issues
- **None identified**

#### Minor Issues

1. **Structural Inconsistency**: Same metadata issues as previous units.
   - Location: Lines 1-7

2. **"be used to" Warning**: While mentioned in common errors (Lines 139-141), the distinction between "used to + verb" and "be used to + -ing" could confuse students since "be used to" is not being taught. Consider removing or simplifying this note.
   - Location: Lines 139-141

3. **Exercise 5 in Section 6** (Lines 519-527): Converting simple past to "used to" is presented, but not all simple past sentences should become "used to". The instructions should clarify that these are for habitual/repeated actions.
   - Location: Lines 519-527

4. **Part E Answer Format** (Line 739): "did/use, used to, Did/use, did, used to, didn't use" - inconsistent slash notation similar to Unit 12.
   - Location: Line 739

### Specific Corrections Needed

1. **Simplify or remove the "be used to" note** (Lines 139-141):
   - Current: Full explanation of "be used to + 동사-ing"
   - Suggested: Remove or simplify to just "주의: 'be used to'는 다른 표현이에요. 나중에 배워요!"

2. **Add clarification to Exercise 5** (Line 519):
   ```markdown
   ## Exercise 5: 단순과거 → used to

   반복적인 과거 습관을 used to로 바꾸세요.
   (주의: 습관적으로 반복된 행동만 used to로 바꿀 수 있어요!)
   ```

3. **Improve answer key formatting** (Line 739):
   - Current: "did/use, used to, Did/use, did, used to, didn't use"
   - Should be: "did, use, used to, Did, use, did, used to, didn't use"
   - Or use separate lines for each blank

4. **Consider adding contrast with simple past** more explicitly:
   - "I used to play soccer" (예전에 했다, 지금은 안 한다)
   - "I played soccer yesterday" (어제 했다, 단순한 과거 사실)
   - Note: This is actually present at Lines 109-115. Already well done.

### Quality Rating

**8.5/10**

### Recommendation

**APPROVE with Minor Revisions**

This unit effectively teaches the "used to" structure with appropriate emphasis on the past-to-present contrast. The summary of all past tense units is a valuable addition. The "be used to" note should be simplified to avoid confusion, and answer key formatting should be improved. Overall, this is a fitting conclusion to the Past Tense series.
