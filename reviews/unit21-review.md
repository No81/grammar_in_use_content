## Detailed Evaluation

### 1. Pedagogical Quality ✅ Excellent (10/10)

**Strengths:**
- **Appropriate sequencing**: Builds logically on Unit 20 (simple passive) → Unit 21 (continuous + perfect passive)
- **Clear distinction**: Effectively contrasts being vs. been, which is a major stumbling block for Korean learners
- **Input flood**: 12+ diverse examples across different passive forms
- **Inductive learning**: Section 2 (Noticing) guides learners to discover being/been patterns themselves
- **Retrieval practice**: Section 3 requires active recall without reference materials
- **Progressive complexity**: Moves from recognition → controlled practice → free production
- **Three-way comparison**: Excellent pedagogical choice to compare simple/continuous/perfect passives (line 38)
- **Spaced repetition**: Section 9 supports memory consolidation
- **Metacognitive support**: Self-assessment in Section 10

**Research-Based Principles Applied:**
- ✅ Comprehensible input with i+1 (Krashen) - builds on known structures
- ✅ Form-focused instruction with meaning emphasis
- ✅ Retrieval practice (Roediger & Karpicke)

## Specific Strengths

### 1. **Exceptional Error Anticipation for Korean Learners**
```yaml
⚠️ 한국 학습자가 자주 하는 실수:
1. being 빠뜨리기: The house is painted now (X) → The house is being painted now (O)
2. been과 being 혼동: The car has being washed (X) → The car has been washed (O)
3. 진행형에 have 사용: The door has being opened (X) → The door is being opened (O)
4. 현재완료에 being 사용: The work has being finished (X) → The work has been finished (O)
```
This section targets the most common and persistent errors Korean learners make with being/been.

### 2. **Outstanding Three-Way Comparison (Lines 38-39)**
```yaml
수동태 형태 비교:
• 단순 현재: The room is cleaned. (방은 청소된다) - 습관/사실
• 현재진행: The room is being cleaned. (방이 청소되고 있다) - 지금 진행 중
• 현재완료: The room has been cleaned. (방이 청소되었다) - 완료/결과
```
This comparison is pedagogically excellent - it helps learners choose the appropriate form based on meaning.

### 3. **Clear being vs. been Distinction**
The unit effectively addresses the most challenging aspect:
- being = 진행형 (지금/그때 ~되고 있다)
- been = 현재완료 (~되어왔다/~되었다)

This distinction appears consistently throughout (Q2, R4, SR8, etc.)

### 4. **Diverse, Contextual Examples**
12+ examples spanning: 현재진행, 과거진행, 현재완료 contexts
- Infrastructure: road, bridge, building
- Daily life: dishes, homework, phone
- Academic: students, test, letters
- Entertainment: game, movie, song

### 5. **Progressive Scaffolding**
- Section 2: Pattern recognition (being vs. been)
- Section 3: Retrieval without materials
- Section 4: Controlled practice (빈칸 채우기)
- Section 5: Guided production (번역)
- Section 6: Transformation practice
- Section 7: Free production with personal contexts
- Section 8: Synthesis and error correction

### 6. **Excellent Diagnostic Question (C2)**
```yaml
C2. 다음 세 문장의 차이를 설명하세요:
a) The room is cleaned.
b) The room is being cleaned.
c) The room has been cleaned.
```
This question tests deep understanding of aspect and passive voice.

## Issues Found

### Critical Issues: None ✅

### Minor Issues:

**Issue 1: Small Inconsistency in Section 8 Question C3**
- **Location:** Lines 193-195
- **Current:**
```yaml
A: How long has it been built? (또는 How long has it been being built?)
```
- **Issue:** While technically possible, "has been being built" (present perfect continuous passive) is very complex and not taught in this unit
- **Suggested revision:**
```yaml
A: How long has it been built?
(또는 더 자연스럽게: How long has the construction been going on?)
```
- **Priority:** Low (the current answer acknowledges the complexity with "또는")
- **Impact:** Minimal - the question is still valuable as-is

**Issue 2: Minor Terminology Note**
- **Location:** Line 109 (Q7)
- **Current:** "The building _____ _____ _____ (build) last year."
- **Expected answer:** "was, being, built"
- **Observation:** "The building was being built last year" is grammatically correct but semantically unusual (suggests ongoing construction throughout last year rather than completion)
- **Alternative interpretation:** Could be "was built" (simple past passive) if we mean completed last year
- **Resolution:** The answer is acceptable as teaching past continuous passive; context determines usage
- **Priority:** Very Low (not requiring change)

## Specific Corrections Needed

### No Critical Corrections Required ✅

### Optional Enhancements (Suggestions Only):

**Enhancement 1: Add Explicit Connection to Unit 20**
- **Location:** Beginning of Section 1 or end of introduction
- **Suggestion:** Add brief reference to Unit 20
- **Example:**
```yaml
- type: text
  content: "<span class='highlight'>Unit 20 복습:</span> 지난 유닛에서 단순 수동태(is/are done, was/were done)를 배웠어요. 이번 유닛에서는 더 복잡한 형태를 배워볼게요!"
```
- **Priority:** Optional (the unit stands well independently)

**Enhancement 2: Clarify Timeline Visual Concept**
- **Location:** Section 1, after line 38 comparison
- **Suggestion:** Consider adding timeline concept explanation
- **Example:**
```yaml
- type: text
  content: "타임라인으로 이해하기:<br />• is done: ----✓---- (일반적 사실)<br />• is being done: ----[NOW]---- (지금 진행)<br />• has been done: [PAST]----✓[NOW] (과거~지금 완료)"
```
- **Priority:** Very Low (current explanations are clear)

**Enhancement 3: Add Note About "By" Usage**
- **Location:** Section 1 or Section 8
- **Observation:** Unit 20 teaches "by" for agent, but Unit 21 examples use "by" less frequently
- **Suggestion:** Brief note about when "by" is/isn't necessary in continuous/perfect passives
- **Priority:** Very Low (not essential)

## Content Innovation Highlights

This unit demonstrates several innovative pedagogical choices:

1. **Three-way comparison approach** (line 38): Contrasting simple/continuous/perfect passives side-by-side is highly effective for understanding aspect
2. **being vs. been focus**: Dedicating explicit attention to this common confusion point
3. **Timeline concepts**: Using "지금 진행 중" vs. "완료/결과" vs. "경험/지속" to distinguish forms
4. **Error pattern anticipation**: All 4 common errors listed in line 36 are actual errors Korean learners make
