# Unit 11 Review: worked/got/went etc. (simple past / 단순 과거)

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Well-Organized Regular vs Irregular Distinction**: The unit clearly separates and explains regular verbs (-ed) and irregular verbs with comprehensive tables. The 20 irregular verbs provided are high-frequency words appropriate for elementary learners.

2. **Strong Scaffolding**: Exercises progress from simple (Part A: regular verbs only, Part B: irregular verbs only) to mixed practice (Part C), allowing students to build confidence before tackling more complex tasks.

3. **Practical "Story Completion" Assessment**: Part E in the comprehensive test provides a contextualized narrative that tests multiple past tense forms in a meaningful context rather than isolated sentences.

### Issues Found

#### Critical Issues
- **None identified**

#### Minor Issues

1. **Structural Inconsistency**: Same metadata structure issues as Unit 10 - missing `level` and `material_volume` fields.
   - Location: Lines 1-7

2. **Spelling Note for "read"**: While the pronunciation note for "read" is excellent (Line 51), it could be made more prominent since this is a very common error point for Korean learners.
   - Location: Line 51

3. **Translation Exercise Answer Ambiguity** (Line 424): For "어젯밤 10시에 잠들었다", the answer "She slept at 10 o'clock last night" is grammatically correct but semantically "slept" means "was sleeping" not "fell asleep". Should be "She fell asleep at 10 PM last night."
   - Location: Lines 424-447

4. **Minor Vocabulary Concern**: "tteokbokki" appears in Unit 8 examples but this unit uses only basic food vocabulary. This is fine for vocabulary progression.

### Specific Corrections Needed

1. **Add missing metadata fields** similar to Unit 10 recommendations

2. **Fix translation answer** (Lines 447):
   - Current: "She slept at 10 o'clock last night."
   - Should be: "She went to sleep at 10 PM last night." or "She fell asleep at 10 PM last night."

3. **Consider highlighting the "read" pronunciation** more prominently, perhaps in a special "Caution!" box

### Quality Rating

**8.5/10**

### Recommendation

**APPROVE with Minor Revisions**

This is a solid unit that effectively teaches the simple past tense with good differentiation between regular and irregular verbs. The comprehensive list of irregular verbs and the memory tips are valuable. The minor translation issue should be corrected before deployment.
