# Unit 13 Review: I was doing (past continuous / 과거진행형)

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Excellent Connection to Prior Knowledge**: The unit effectively builds on students' understanding of present continuous (am/is/are + -ing) by showing the parallel structure (was/were + -ing). The comparison table in Section 1 (Lines 30-36) makes this connection explicit.

2. **Clear "When" Clause Introduction**: The unit introduces the "when" clause structure naturally (e.g., "I was eating when you called"), which sets up perfectly for Unit 14's deeper comparison.

3. **Practical Time-Based Exercises**: Section 7's "specific time" exercises (7 AM, 12 PM, 3 PM, etc.) provide concrete, relatable contexts for 6th graders to practice.

### Issues Found

#### Critical Issues
- **None identified**

#### Minor Issues

1. **Structural Inconsistency**: Same metadata issues as previous units.
   - Location: Lines 1-7

2. **Part E Answer Ambiguity** (Line 685): "didn't hear / wasn't hearing" - both answers are provided but "wasn't hearing" is less natural in this context. Should clarify the preferred answer.
   - Location: Line 685

3. **Section 7 Incomplete Guidance**: The "Family" exercise (Lines 557-566) asks about pets but doesn't provide example answers, which could confuse students about appropriate responses.
   - Location: Lines 563-565

4. **Potential Difficulty Jump**: The "when" clause concept is introduced relatively quickly. Some students might benefit from more isolated practice of the basic form before combining with "when" clauses.
   - Location: Section 1, Lines 54-62

### Specific Corrections Needed

1. **Clarify Part E answer** (Line 685):
   - Current: "didn't hear / wasn't hearing"
   - Should be: "didn't hear" (preferred, as "wasn't hearing" sounds unnatural for sudden phone sounds)

2. **Add sample answers for pet exercise** (Line 565):
   ```markdown
   예시: My pet was sleeping on the sofa.

   1. My dad was _________________________________
   2. My sister/brother was _________________________________
   3. My pet was _________________________________ (예: sleeping, eating, playing)
   ```

3. **Consider adding a scaffolded exercise** that practices basic past continuous without "when" clauses before introducing combined structures

### Quality Rating

**8.5/10**

### Recommendation

**APPROVE with Minor Revisions**

The unit provides a solid foundation for understanding past continuous tense. The connection to present continuous is well-established, and the variety of contexts (specific times, when clauses) is appropriate. Minor clarifications to answer keys and example answers would improve usability.
