# Content Review Report - Unit 18

## Unit: for / since / ago (Duration and Point Expressions)

---

## Overall Assessment

Unit 18 provides comprehensive coverage of three essential time expressions (for, since, ago) with clear distinctions and abundant practice. The content effectively addresses a commonly confused area for Korean learners. The unit shows strong pedagogical design with appropriate scaffolding and excellent comparison tables.

**Overall Rating**: Excellent

**Quality Score**: 9/10

---

## Strengths

1. **Outstanding Comparison Framework**: The three-way comparison (for = duration, since = starting point, ago = past point) is clearly presented and consistently reinforced
2. **Excellent Tense-Time Expression Pairing**: Explicitly teaches that for/since go with present perfect while ago goes with simple past - a crucial rule
3. **Strong Example Diversity**: 12 diverse examples in Section 1 covering various contexts with clear labels (for/since/ago)
4. **Effective L1 Transfer Error Coverage**: Addresses common Korean learner errors like "since three years" and "I have met him two days ago"
5. **Innovative Transformation Practice**: Section 6 exercises require students to convert between for/since/ago expressions, reinforcing conceptual understanding
6. **Practical Integration**: Section 7 asks students to express the same fact using different time expressions - excellent for deep understanding

## Issues Found

### Critical Errors (Must Fix)

**None identified** - All grammar rules are accurate, YAML structure is correct, and examples are appropriate.

### Pedagogical Concerns (Should Fix)

1. **Section 6, TF1 and TF2** - Time Calculation Ambiguity
   - **Issue**: Answers require students to calculate current year minus starting year, but the current year isn't specified
   - **Location**: TF1 says "since 2021/2022" and TF2 mentions "현재 달에 따라 다름"
   - **Impact**: Students may be confused about what year to use for calculations
   - **Suggestion**: Either specify "현재가 2025년이라면..." or use evergreen examples like "for three years / since 2019"

2. **Section 6, TF6** - Age Dependency
   - **Issue**: Answer states "He has had this dog for about 2 years" but depends on current age which isn't given
   - **Impact**: Incomplete information for students to calculate
   - **Suggestion**: Add context like "He is now 12" or use a fixed year reference

3. **Section 8, C4** - Time Calculation
   - **Issue**: Similar to Section 6, "for about 4-5 years" is imprecise when 2020 to 2025 is exactly 5 years
   - **Impact**: Teaches imprecise calculation
   - **Suggestion**: Change to "for five years" or "for about five years"

### Enhancement Opportunities (Nice to Have)

1. **Visual Timeline**: Add a simple timeline showing the relationship between for/since/ago
2. **"since" with Clauses**: Section 1 mentions "since I was young" but could have more examples of since + clause
3. **Negative Sentences**: Add examples like "I haven't seen her since Monday" / "I haven't eaten for hours"

## Priority Recommendations

### Top 3 Changes to Make:

1. **Fix time calculation ambiguity in Section 6**: Add specific year context or use evergreen examples
   - **Rationale**: Students need clear information to complete exercises correctly
   - **Specific fix for TF1**: Change to "I have lived here for three years" → "I have lived here since 2022 (if now is 2025)"

2. **Update C4 in Section 8**: Change "for about 4-5 years" to "for five years"
   - **Rationale**: Mathematical accuracy reinforces learning

3. **Add TF6 context**: Specify the person's current age or use a fixed year
   - **Rationale**: Incomplete information prevents proper answer verification

---

## Enhancement Ideas

- Add a visual timeline diagram showing:
  - "since 2020" (point) → present (with arrow)
  - "for 5 years" (duration bracket)
  - "5 years ago" (single point in past)
- Include more "since + clause" examples: "since I started school," "since we moved here"
- Add negative sentence examples to show that for/since work the same in negatives
- Consider a quick quiz format comparing similar sentences: "I lived there for 5 years" vs "I have lived here for 5 years"
