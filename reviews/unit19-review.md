# Content Review Report - Unit 19

## Unit: I have done (present perfect) and I did (past) - Comparison

---

## Overall Assessment

Unit 19 serves as an excellent capstone for the Present Perfect series (Units 16-19) by providing a comprehensive comparison between present perfect and simple past. The content effectively synthesizes previous learning while introducing crucial distinguishing features. The unit demonstrates strong pedagogical design with clear rules, abundant examples, and progressive practice.

**Overall Rating**: Excellent

**Quality Score**: 9/10

---

## Strengths

1. **Masterful Comparison Framework**: Presents the fundamental distinction (connection to present vs. completed past) with exceptional clarity
2. **Excellent Signal Words Coverage**: Clearly categorizes time expressions that trigger each tense (yesterday/ago = past, ever/just/already = present perfect)
3. **Outstanding Example Pairs**: Section 1 presents 12 examples in parallel pairs (present perfect vs. simple past) showing the same action in different contexts
4. **Strong L1 Transfer Error Awareness**: Addresses the critical issue that Korean doesn't have this distinction ("~했다" for both)
5. **Practical Decision Rule**: "When?(언제?) 질문에 답이 있으면 단순과거!" - excellent memory aid for students
6. **Effective Transformation Practice**: Section 6 exercises require converting between tenses by adding/removing time expressions - reinforces the key rule

## Issues Found

### Critical Errors (Must Fix)

**None identified** - All grammar explanations are accurate, YAML structure is correct, and the comparative framework is pedagogically sound.

### Pedagogical Concerns (Should Fix)

1. **Section 1, Line 35 Typo**
   - **Issue**: "지금은 안 삼" should probably be "지금은 안 살음" or "지금은 살지 않음"
   - **Location**: "They lived there for ten years. (그들은 10년 동안 거기 살았어. → 지금은 안 삼)"
   - **Impact**: Informal/potentially unclear Korean expression
   - **Suggestion**: Change to "지금은 거기 살지 않음" for clarity

2. **Section 6, TF6** - Verb Change Not Explained
   - **Issue**: The transformation changes "moved" to "lived" but doesn't explain why
   - **Location**: "They moved here in 2020" → "They have lived here for four years"
   - **Impact**: Students might not understand why the verb changed
   - **Suggestion**: Add explanation: "moved는 순간 동작, lived는 지속 상태이므로 현재완료로 바꿀 때 동사도 바꿔요"

3. **Section 4, Q4** - Potential Ambiguity
   - **Issue**: "Have, been" uses "be" verb which might confuse students about the experience meaning
   - **Location**: "_____ you ever _____ (be) to Japan?"
   - **Impact**: Students might not understand "been to" = "visited"
   - **Suggestion**: Add brief note: "have been to = 가본 적이 있다 (visited와 비슷한 의미)"

### Enhancement Opportunities (Nice to Have)

1. **State vs Action Verbs**: Brief mention that some verbs work better with present perfect (know, have, live)
2. **American vs British Usage**: Note that American English sometimes uses simple past with just/already/yet
3. **More Complex Contexts**: Add examples with "this week/month/year" which can take either tense depending on context

## Priority Recommendations

### Top 3 Changes to Make:

1. **Fix Korean typo in Section 1, Line 35**: Change "지금은 안 삼" to "지금은 거기 살지 않음"
   - **Rationale**: Clear Korean is essential for comprehension

2. **Add explanation for TF6 verb change**: Explain why "moved" becomes "lived" in the transformation
   - **Rationale**: Without explanation, students won't understand the semantic shift from punctual to durative

3. **Add "been to" note for Q4**: Briefly explain that "have been to" means "have visited"
   - **Rationale**: This is a set phrase that students might not recognize

---

## Enhancement Ideas

- Add a "Quick Decision Chart":
  - Time expression with specific past time? → Simple Past
  - No time expression OR ever/just/already/yet? → Present Perfect
- Include examples with "today/this week" showing both tenses are possible depending on whether the period is viewed as complete
- Add a section on "just" placement (I have just arrived vs. I just arrived in American English)
- Consider a summary table comparing Units 16-19 to show the progression

As the final unit in the Present Perfect series (16-19), Unit 19 effectively:
- Synthesizes concepts from Units 16 (questions), 17 (duration), and 18 (for/since/ago)
- Provides the crucial "when to use which" decision framework
- Prepares students for more advanced tense distinctions in future learning

The four-unit series demonstrates excellent pedagogical progression from form (16) to duration (17-18) to comparative choice (19).
