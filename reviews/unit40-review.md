## Overview
- **Title:** Unit 40 - too/either, so am I / neither do I (Agreement Expressions)

- **Target Audience:** 6th Grade Korean Learners
- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Recommended Time:** 30 minutes (A4 2p)

---

## Evaluation Criteria Assessment

### 1. Pedagogical Quality (10/10)

**Strengths:**
- Excellent three-way presentation: Me too/neither, So/Neither + aux + I, I do/am too
- Strong emphasis on inversion structure (So am I vs. So I am)
- Progressive difficulty: simple expressions first, then inversion, then varied subjects
- Clear explanation of positive/negative agreement distinction

**No issues found.**

### 2. Content Accuracy (10/10)

**Strengths:**
- All agreement forms correctly presented
- Accurate auxiliary matching rules
- Correct inversion word order (So + aux + subject)
- Proper distinction between positive (too/So) and negative (either/Neither) contexts

**No issues found:** All grammatical content is accurate.

### 3. Completeness (9/10)

**Strengths:**
- All 10 required sections present
- Comprehensive auxiliary coverage (am/is/are, do/does/did, can, will, have)
- Three methods of expressing agreement taught for each context
- Includes practice with varied subjects (he, she, they, my friend, etc.)

**Minor Issue:**
- Could include brief mention of less common but valid alternatives (e.g., "Nor do I" as alternative to "Neither do I")

### 4. Format & Structure (10/10)

**Strengths:**
- Consistent YAML structure throughout
- Proper type designations
- Clean formatting
- Matches template exactly

**No syntax errors detected.**

### 5. Target Audience Alignment (9/10)

**Strengths:**
- Korean translations provided
- Common Korean learner errors explicitly addressed (positive/negative confusion, auxiliary mismatch)
- Age-appropriate contexts (K-pop, games, school, friends)
- Progressive difficulty appropriate for 6th grade

**Minor Issue:**
- The distinction between formal (So do I) and informal (Me too) could be more explicitly stated for Korean learners who value register awareness

### 6. Consistency with Existing Units (10/10)

**Strengths:**
- Same 10-section structure as unit35
- Consistent formatting conventions
- Similar exercise variety
- Parallel depth of content

## Detailed Findings

### Strengths (Top 3)

1. **Three-Way Expression System:** Teaching Me too, So do I, and I do too simultaneously gives learners multiple tools and demonstrates that native speakers use all three interchangeably.

2. **Auxiliary Matching Focus:** Strong emphasis on matching the auxiliary to the original statement (be = am/is/are, regular verb = do/does/did) prevents common errors.

3. **Inversion Clarity:** The explicit "So am I (O) vs. So I am (X)" comparison directly addresses a common word order error.

### Issues Found

#### Critical Issues: None

#### Minor Issues:

1. **Section 1, Lines 46-47 (Note):** Error examples could be more comprehensive.
   - **Current:** Lists 4 common errors
   - **Suggested:** Add one more: "Auxiliary tense mismatch: I went there. - So do I (X) -> So did I (O)"

2. **Section 5, Line 136 (T1):** The instruction "three methods" may overwhelm some learners.
   - **Suggestion:** Consider making the third method (I do too) optional or marking it as "bonus"

3. **No explicit register guidance:**
   - **Suggestion:** Add a brief note in Section 1 explaining:
     - "Me too/Me neither" = casual, everyday conversation
     - "So do I/Neither do I" = slightly more formal, also common in writing
     - "I do too/I don't either" = neutral, can be used anywhere

---

## Specific Corrections Needed

### No critical corrections required.

### Minor enhancement suggestions:

1. **Section 1, after Line 47 (Note section):** Add one more error example:
   - **Add:** "5. Tense mismatch: I went there. - So do I (X) -> So did I (O)"

2. **Section 1, after Line 16:** Add register note:
   ```yaml
   - type: text
     content: "<span class='highlight'>Register (formal/informal):</span><br />
       - Me too / Me neither: Very casual, used with friends<br />
       - So do I / Neither do I: Slightly more formal, also used in writing<br />
       - I do too / I don't either: Neutral, works in all situations"
   ```

3. **Section 6, Line 161 (TF3):** The example could be slightly simplified.
   - **Current:** "She can't dance. (He can't either)"
   - **Consider:** Keeping as is (appropriate difficulty)

## Recommendation

**APPROVED**

This unit exceeds the target score of 9/10. The pedagogical approach of teaching three parallel structures for agreement expressions is particularly effective. Minor suggestions above are optional improvements. The unit demonstrates excellent design and is ready for use.

## Reviewer Notes

- Excellent treatment of a grammatically complex topic (inversion)
- Clear organization: positive agreement -> negative agreement -> combined practice
- Strong attention to common L1 interference errors
- Practical examples using K-pop, games, and school life engage 6th-grade learners
- The "varied subjects" practice (Section 6) prepares learners for real conversations where they discuss third parties
