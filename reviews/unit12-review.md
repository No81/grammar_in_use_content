# Unit 12 Review: I didn't... Did you...? (simple past negative and questions)

## Quality Assessment

### Strengths

1. **Critical Grammar Point Emphasis**: The unit repeatedly emphasizes the key rule that "didn't/Did + verb base form" (not past tense), which is exactly what Korean learners struggle with most. This is reinforced through multiple exercises and error correction sections.

2. **Excellent Error Correction Exercises**: Parts C in both practice (Lines 495-555) and comprehensive test (Lines 683-699) specifically target the most common errors (didn't went, Did you ate), providing focused remediation.

3. **Complete Coverage of Question Types**: The unit covers yes/no questions, short answers, AND wh-questions (What/Where/When/Why/How), giving students a complete toolkit for past tense interrogatives.

### Issues Found

#### Critical Issues
- **None identified**

#### Minor Issues

1. **Structural Inconsistency**: Same metadata issues as previous units.
   - Location: Lines 1-7

2. **Repetitive Error Examples**: The same errors (didn't went, Did you ate) appear in multiple sections. While repetition aids learning, some variety might be beneficial.
   - Location: Multiple sections

3. **Part E Answer Format** (Line 752): "Did/go, didn't, Did/see, did, What/eat, didn't eat, didn't do" - the slash notation is inconsistent and could confuse students. Should be clearer formatting.
   - Location: Line 752

4. **Missing Transition Link**: The unit jumps directly into negatives/questions without briefly reviewing what was learned in Unit 11 (simple past affirmatives).
   - Location: Section 1, opening

### Specific Corrections Needed

1. **Add brief review connection** at the start of Section 1:
   ```markdown
   Unit 11에서 과거형 긍정문을 배웠어요 (I went, She ate).
   ```
   - Note: This is actually already present at Line 15-16. No change needed.

2. **Improve answer key formatting** (Line 752):
   - Current: "Did/go, didn't, Did/see, did, What/eat, didn't eat, didn't do"
   - Should be: "Did, go, didn't, Did, see, did, What, eat, didn't eat, didn't do"
   - Or provide separate lines for clarity

3. **Add one or two additional error types** to Section 6 Exercise 2, such as:
   - "She not didn't go" (double negative error)
   - "Did went you?" (word order error)

### Quality Rating

**8.5/10**

### Recommendation

**APPROVE with Minor Revisions**

This unit effectively addresses one of the most challenging aspects of English grammar for Korean learners. The repeated emphasis on using the base form after did/didn't is pedagogically sound. The answer key formatting issue should be fixed for clarity.
