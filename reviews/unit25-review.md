2. **Grammatically Perfect** - 100% accurate explanations and examples
3. **Culturally Tailored** - Expertly adapted for Korean 6th graders
4. **Progressive Scaffolding** - Smooth difficulty curve from basic to advanced

### Specific Excellence Examples:

**Example 1 - Excellent Error Anticipation (Line 36):**
```
⚠️ 한국 학습자가 자주 하는 실수:
1. to 뒤에 -ing 사용: going to studying (X) → going to study (O)
2. be동사 빠뜨리기: I going to go (X) → I am going to go (O)
```
This shows deep understanding of Korean learner error patterns.

**Example 2 - Clear Distinction from Similar Structures (Line 38):**
```
