## ISSUES FOUND

### Critical Issues
**NONE** - No critical errors that would prevent publication.

### Minor Issues

**1. Minor Pedagogical Enhancement Opportunity (Optional)**
- **Location:** Section 2, line 50
- **Issue:** Important note about be/have/do being irregular could be more prominent
- **Current:** Single note at end of Unit 22 summary
- **Suggestion:** Consider adding to Section 3 (Retrieval Practice) as a recall question
- **Example:** "R9. be, have, do는 규칙동사인가요, 불규칙동사인가요? 왜 그렇게 생각하나요?"
- **Severity:** Very low (current placement is acceptable)

**2. Potential Expansion (Optional)**
- **Location:** Section 9, Part B (lines 263-293)
- **Enhancement:** Part B asks for 10 past forms but could include 1-2 mixed items requiring spelling rule application
- **Example:** Add "16. carry → ___" (tests consonant+y rule from Unit 23)
- **Severity:** Very low (current coverage is comprehensive)

**3. Typo Check (None found)**
- Thoroughly reviewed all Korean text - no spelling errors detected
- All English grammar accurate
- YAML syntax valid

### Strengths Worth Highlighting

**1. Outstanding Error Prediction (Section 8)**
Lines 206-240: Common mistakes section addresses exactly the errors Korean learners make:
- He have → He has (3rd person singular)
- He doed → He did (irregular verb regularization)
- I goed → I went (same)
- didn't went → didn't go (past tense in negative)
- Did he ate → Did he eat (past tense in question)

**2. Excellent Metacognitive Scaffolding**
Section 1 (pre-assessment) and Section 10 (post-assessment) create perfect bookends:
- Same concepts checked before/after
- Growth mindset language ("괜찮아요! 천천히...")
- Concrete next steps provided

**3. Perfect Spaced Repetition Schedule**
Lines 359-368: Research-based intervals
- 1 day: Section 3 (retrieval)
- 3 days: Section 4 (diagnostic)
- 1 week: Section 9 (comprehensive test)
- 2 weeks: Irregular verb focused practice
- 1 month: Full units review

**4. Exceptional Real-Life Integration (Section 7)**
Lines 189-205: Tasks require genuine communicative competence
- R1: Combining be/have/do with regular/irregular verbs in narrative
- R4: Creating authentic interview dialogue
- All require 6-7+ sentences of sustained production

## REVIEWER NOTES

This review file represents a mature understanding of:
- Evidence-based learning science (retrieval practice, spaced repetition, interleaving)
- Korean EFL learner challenges (common error patterns)
- Developmental appropriateness (6th grade cognitive/linguistic level)
- Comprehensive assessment design (diagnostic → formative → summative)

The integration of Units 22-23 is particularly strong because both units deal with verb forms (present/past), creating natural opportunities for comparison and contrast. The file leverages this connection throughout, especially in Sections 5-7.

**Quality comparable to professionally published EFL materials.**
