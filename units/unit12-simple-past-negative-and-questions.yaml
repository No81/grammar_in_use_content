      # 단순 과거의 부정문과 의문문

      Unit 11에서 과거형 긍정문을 배웠어요 (I went, She ate).
      이번에는 부정문(~하지 않았다)과 의문문(~했니?)을 배워요!

      ## 1. 부정문: did not (didn't) + 동사원형

      **중요:** 부정문에서는 동사가 원형으로 돌아가요!

      | 긍정문 | 부정문 |
      |--------|--------|
      | I went | I didn't go |
      | She ate | She didn't eat |
      | We played | We didn't play |
      | He watched | He didn't watch |

      **예문:**
      - I didn't go to school yesterday. (나는 어제 학교에 가지 않았다.)
      - She didn't eat breakfast. (그녀는 아침을 먹지 않았다.)
      - We didn't play soccer. (우리는 축구를 하지 않았다.)
      - He didn't watch TV. (그는 TV를 보지 않았다.)
      - They didn't come to the party. (그들은 파티에 오지 않았다.)

      ## 2. 의문문: Did + 주어 + 동사원형?

      **중요:** 의문문에서도 동사가 원형으로 돌아가요!

      | 긍정문 | 의문문 |
      |--------|--------|
      | You went | Did you go? |
      | She ate | Did she eat? |
      | They played | Did they play? |

      **예문:**
      - Did you go to school? (너는 학교에 갔니?)
      - Did she eat lunch? (그녀는 점심을 먹었니?)
      - Did they play games? (그들은 게임을 했니?)
      - Did he watch the movie? (그는 영화를 봤니?)

      ## 3. 짧은 대답 (Short answers)

      **긍정:** Yes, 주어 + did.
      **부정:** No, 주어 + didn't.

      - Did you go to school? - Yes, I did. / No, I didn't.
      - Did she eat lunch? - Yes, she did. / No, she didn't.
      - Did they come? - Yes, they did. / No, they didn't.

      ## 4. 의문사가 있는 질문

      **What/Where/When/Why/How + did + 주어 + 동사원형?**

      - What did you eat? (너는 무엇을 먹었니?)
      - Where did you go? (너는 어디에 갔니?)
      - When did you come home? (너는 언제 집에 왔니?)
      - Why did you cry? (너는 왜 울었니?)
      - How did you go to school? (너는 어떻게 학교에 갔니?)

      ## 다양한 예문

      ### 일상생활
      - I didn't wake up early. (나는 일찍 일어나지 않았다.)
      - Did you eat breakfast? (너는 아침 먹었니?)
      - She didn't do her homework. (그녀는 숙제를 하지 않았다.)

      ### 학교생활
      - We didn't have a test. (우리는 시험이 없었다.)
      - Did you study for the test? (너는 시험 공부했니?)
      - The teacher didn't give us homework. (선생님이 우리에게 숙제를 안 내주셨다.)

      ### 주말/여가
      - I didn't go anywhere yesterday. (나는 어제 아무 데도 가지 않았다.)
      - Did you watch the movie? (너는 그 영화 봤니?)
      - They didn't play games last night. (그들은 어젯밤 게임을 하지 않았다.)

      ### 음식
      - I didn't eat pizza. (나는 피자를 먹지 않았다.)
      - Did she like the food? (그녀는 음식을 좋아했니?)
      - We didn't have dinner. (우리는 저녁을 먹지 않았다.)

      ## 핵심 규칙

      **didn't / Did 뒤에는 항상 동사원형!**

      - ❌ I didn't went to school.
      - ✅ I didn't go to school.

      - ❌ Did you went to school?
      - ✅ Did you go to school?

      ## 한국 학습자가 자주 하는 실수

      1. **동사를 과거형으로 쓰는 실수**
         - ❌ I didn't went.
         - ✅ I didn't go.

      2. **Did 뒤에 과거형 쓰는 실수**
         - ❌ Did you ate?
         - ✅ Did you eat?

      3. **짧은 대답에서 동사 추가**
         - ❌ Yes, I did go.
         - ✅ Yes, I did.

      4. **주어 빠뜨리기**
         - ❌ Did go to school?
         - ✅ Did you go to school?

      # 문장 관찰하기 - 패턴을 발견해봐요!

      아래 문장들을 읽고 패턴을 찾아보세요.

      ## Group A: 긍정문 vs 부정문

      긍정문: I went to school.
      부정문: I didn't go to school.

      긍정문: She ate pizza.
      부정문: She didn't eat pizza.

      긍정문: They played games.
      부정문: They didn't play games.

      긍정문: He watched TV.
      부정문: He didn't watch TV.

      ## Group B: 긍정문 vs 의문문

      긍정문: You went to school.
      의문문: Did you go to school?

      긍정문: She ate lunch.
      의문문: Did she eat lunch?

      긍정문: They came to the party.
      의문문: Did they come to the party?

      ---

      ## 발견 질문

      1. **부정문 관찰:** "didn't" 뒤에 오는 동사의 형태는 어떤가요?
         (과거형? 원형?)
         답: _________________

      2. **의문문 관찰:** "Did" 뒤에 오는 동사의 형태는 어떤가요?
         답: _________________

      3. **패턴 발견:** went → go, ate → eat로 바뀌는 이유는 무엇일까요?
         답: _________________

      4. **공통점:** 부정문과 의문문에서 공통으로 사용되는 단어는?
         답: _________________

      ---

      ## 패턴 정리

      **핵심 발견:** didn't와 Did가 과거의 의미를 담고 있기 때문에,
      동사는 원형으로 돌아갑니다!

      - didn't + 동사원형 = 부정문
      - Did + 주어 + 동사원형? = 의문문

      💡 **중요:** 과거 시제는 did/didn't에 들어있어요!

      ## 핵심 규칙

      ✅ didn't + 동사원형
      ✅ Did + 주어 + 동사원형?
      ✅ 짧은 대답: Yes, I did. / No, I didn't.

      ## 자기 점검 체크리스트

      ☐ 부정문을 만들 수 있어요 (didn't + 동사원형)
      ☐ 의문문을 만들 수 있어요 (Did + 주어 + 동사원형?)
      ☐ 짧은 대답을 할 수 있어요 (Yes, I did. / No, I didn't.)
      ☐ 의문사 질문을 만들 수 있어요 (What/Where/When did you...?)
      ☐ didn't/Did 뒤에는 항상 동사원형이 온다는 것을 알아요

      ## 실력 레벨 확인

      - **5개:** 완벽해요! 과거 시제 완전 정복!
      - **3-4개:** 잘했어요! 연습만 더 하면 완벽!
      - **1-2개:** 괜찮아요! 핵심 규칙을 다시 확인!

      ---

      ## 격려 메시지

      축하합니다!

      오늘 여러분은 과거 시제의 부정문과 의문문을 배웠어요!

      이제 여러분은:
      - "나는 ~하지 않았다"를 말할 수 있어요
      - "너는 ~했니?"라고 물어볼 수 있어요
      - 친구와 과거에 대해 대화할 수 있어요

      **핵심만 기억하세요:**
      didn't / Did 뒤에는 항상 **동사원형**!

      went → didn't go, Did you go?
      ate → didn't eat, Did you eat?

      ---

      ## 다음 단계

      **내일:** Section 9 복습 문제 풀기
      **이번 주:** 친구와 과거에 대한 대화 연습하기
      **다음 단원:** Unit 13에서 과거진행형을 배워요! (I was doing)

      **Great job! 파이팅!**
