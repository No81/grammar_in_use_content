      ✅ 부정문: wasn't / weren't
      ✅ 의문문: Was/Were + 주어 ~?

      ## 자기 점검 체크리스트

      오늘 배운 내용을 얼마나 이해했는지 체크해보세요!

      ☐ am/is의 과거형이 was라는 것을 알아요
      ☐ are의 과거형이 were라는 것을 알아요
      ☐ 주어에 따라 was/were를 올바르게 선택할 수 있어요
      ☐ 부정문을 만들 수 있어요 (wasn't, weren't)
      ☐ 의문문을 만들 수 있어요 (Was ~? Were ~?)

      ## 실력 레벨 확인

      체크한 개수를 세어보세요:

      - **6개:** 완벽해요! 다음 단원으로 GO!
      - **4-5개:** 아주 잘했어요! 조금만 더 연습!
      - **2-3개:** 잘하고 있어요! 복습 필요!
      - **0-1개:** 괜찮아요! 다시 천천히 읽어보세요!

      ## 격려 메시지

      축하합니다!

      오늘 여러분은 영어에서 매우 중요한 과거 시제의 첫 번째 단원을 마쳤어요!

      was/were는 영어에서 가장 자주 사용되는 과거형 중 하나예요.
      "I was happy yesterday." "They were at school." 이런 문장을
      이제 자신 있게 말할 수 있게 되었어요!

      이제 여러분은:
      - 과거의 감정과 상태를 표현할 수 있어요
      - 과거에 어디에 있었는지 말할 수 있어요
      - 과거에 대해 질문하고 대답할 수 있어요

      **기억하세요:**
      영어 과거형은 한국어와 달리 동사 형태가 바뀌어요.
      am/is → was, are → were 이 변화를 잘 기억하세요!

      ## 다음 단계

      **내일:** Section 9 복습 문제 풀기
      **이번 주:** 일상에서 was/were 사용해보기
      **다음 단원:** Unit 11에서 일반동사의 과거형을 배워요! (worked, went, etc.)

      **다음 단원도 파이팅!**
