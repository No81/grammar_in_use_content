notes: |
  이 복습 자료는 Unit 48 간접화법의 핵심 개념을 종합적으로 복습하도록 설계되었습니다.
  단일 Unit이지만 간접화법은 4가지 핵심 변화(said/told, 시제, 인칭, 시간/장소)를
  모두 적용해야 하므로 충분한 연습이 필요합니다.

  특히 한국 학습자들이 어려워하는 부분들을 집중적으로 다룹니다:
  - said와 told의 목적어 사용 차이
  - 간접화법에서의 시제 변화 (한국어에는 없는 개념)
  - 인칭 변화 (화자 관점의 이동)
  - 시간/장소 표현 변화

  회상 연습과 인터리빙에 중점을 두어 장기 기억에 효과적이며,
  진단 테스트와 약점별 집중 복습을 통해 개인화된 학습이 가능합니다.
