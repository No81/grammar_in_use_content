      ## 핵심 규칙

      ✅ 과거진행형 = was/were + 동사-ing
      ✅ I, He, She, It → was
      ✅ You, We, They → were

      # 오늘 공부 마무리

      ## 자기 점검 체크리스트

      ☐ 과거진행형의 형태를 알아요 (was/were + 동사-ing)
      ☐ 주어에 따라 was/were를 올바르게 선택할 수 있어요
      ☐ 과거진행형 부정문과 의문문을 만들 수 있어요
      ☐ "~했을 때 ~하고 있었다"를 표현할 수 있어요
      ☐ 현재진행형과 과거진행형의 차이를 알아요

      ## 실력 레벨 확인

      - **5개:** 완벽해요! 과거진행형 완전 이해!
      - **3-4개:** 잘했어요! 연습만 더 하면 완벽!
      - **1-2개:** 괜찮아요! 복습 필요!

      ## 격려 메시지

      축하합니다!

      오늘 여러분은 과거진행형을 배웠어요!

      이제 여러분은:
      - "그때 ~하고 있었다"를 표현할 수 있어요
      - "네가 전화했을 때 뭘 하고 있었니?"라고 물어볼 수 있어요
      - 과거의 특정 순간을 생생하게 묘사할 수 있어요

      **현재진행형과 비교해보세요:**
      - I am watching TV. (지금 보고 있다)
      - I was watching TV. (그때 보고 있었다)

      ## 다음 단계

      **내일:** Section 9 복습 문제 풀기
      **이번 주:** 어제 특정 시간에 뭘 했는지 영어로 말해보기
      **다음 단원:** Unit 14에서 과거진행형과 단순 과거의 차이를 배워요!

      **Keep up the great work! 파이팅!**
